Seiko later went on to introduce the first quartz chronograph.<br>In the late 1980s, Seiko produced the first automatic quartz that combined the self-energizing attributes of an automatic watch with quartz accuracy. The watch is entirely powered by its movement in everyday wear.[14] In 1991, to increase popularity, these watches were relaunched under the name Seiko Kinetic.[15]</br> In 1985, Orient and Seiko established a joint factory.</br>Currently watch movements are made in Shizukuishi, Iwate (SII Morioka Seiko Instruments), Ninohe, Iwate (SII Ninohe Tokei Kogyo), Shiojiri, Nagano (Seiko Epson) and their subsidiaries in China, Malaysia and Singapore.
